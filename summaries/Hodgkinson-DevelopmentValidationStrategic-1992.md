## Research Question
*What problem or question does this paper address?*

What problems exist with using Rotter's general I-E scale to study locus of control beliefs in strategic management contexts, and how can a domain-specific measure be developed to overcome these limitations?

## Methodology
*How did the researchers approach the problem?*

The researchers developed a 16-item Strategic Locus of Control Scale from an initial pool of 36 items derived from conceptual analysis, then validated it using two samples (94 small business owner-managers and 208 real estate brokers) against existing measures and social desirability scales.

## Key Findings
*What are the main results or conclusions?*

- The Strategic Locus of Control Scale demonstrated acceptable reliability and construct validity across both samples
- The scale successfully avoided correlation with social desirability response bias, unlike Rotter's I-E scale
- The domain-specific strategic scale showed expected correlations with work locus of control and strategy-making variables

## Core Argument
*What is the central thesis or contribution?*

Rotter's general I-E scale is inadequate for strategic management research due to lack of context-specificity and correlation with social desirability bias. A domain-specific Strategic Locus of Control Scale provides a more valid instrument for investigating how managers' control beliefs relate to strategic decision-making, organizational structure, and environmental scanning behaviors.

## Evidence & Support
*What data or reasoning supports the claims?*

The validation study employed convergent validity testing against established measures (Rotter I-E, Work Locus of Control) and criterion validity testing against strategy-making variables previously shown to correlate with locus of control beliefs.

## Critical Notes

### Strengths

- Addresses clear methodological problems in existing strategic management research
- Follows established psychometric development procedures with multiple validation criteria

### Limitations

- Limited sample diversity (primarily UK small businesses and real estate professionals)
- Full validation results and statistical details are not provided in this abbreviated version

### Open Questions
*What remains unresolved or needs further investigation?*

- How does the scale perform across different organizational contexts and cultural settings?
- What are the specific relationships between strategic locus of control and various strategic management outcomes?

- **Phares (1976)** — Argued that Rotter's I-E scale was only a rough measure and recommended researchers develop context-specific scales for their domains

## Summary
*2-3 sentence overview in your own words*

This paper develops a new Strategic Locus of Control Scale specifically designed for strategic management research to replace Rotter's general I-E scale. The new measure overcomes problems of context-specificity and social desirability bias while maintaining validity for studying how managers' control beliefs influence strategic decision-making.
