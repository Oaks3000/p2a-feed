## Research Question
*What problem or question does this paper address?*

How do different conceptualizations of luck between academics and practitioners create a relevance gap in performance management research, and how can this gap be bridged to better address volatile business environments? The paper examines why academics tend to exclude luck as an explanatory factor in performance while practitioners frequently invoke it when facing uncertainty.

## Methodology
*How did the researchers approach the problem?*

The authors conduct a conceptual analysis examining the theoretical divide between academic and practitioner perspectives on luck and causality in performance management. They propose adopting a Mode 2 research approach that involves practitioners in knowledge creation rather than the traditional Mode 1 academic-only approach.

## Key Findings
*What are the main results or conclusions?*

- Academics view luck as a post facto phenomenon indicating random variation, while practitioners attribute outcomes to luck when they don't understand the underlying causes
- The dominant positivist philosophy in academic research essentially excludes luck as an explanatory phenomenon, creating a disconnect with practitioner experience
- A Mode 2 research approach involving both academics and practitioners in knowledge creation could produce more meaningful findings for managing performance in volatile environments

## Core Argument
*What is the central thesis or contribution?*

The relevance gap between academic research and business practice stems partly from fundamentally different conceptualizations of luck and causality in performance management. Academic research's "hard science" approach, which excludes luck as an explanatory factor, fails to address the realities practitioners face in volatile environments where traditional causal models break down.

## Evidence & Support
*What data or reasoning supports the claims?*

The authors point to the failure of sophisticated academic models to predict global crises like the 2008 financial crisis and cite examples like the significant variance between predicted and actual unemployment rates despite policy interventions. They argue that the increasing technical and narrow focus of academic knowledge has separated it from practical management contexts.

## Critical Notes

### Strengths

- Addresses a fundamental epistemological issue affecting the practical relevance of management research
- Proposes a concrete alternative approach (Mode 2 research) for bridging the academic-practitioner divide

### Limitations

- Primarily conceptual analysis without empirical evidence supporting the proposed Mode 2 approach
- Limited exploration of how luck could be systematically incorporated into performance management frameworks while maintaining analytical rigor

### Open Questions
*What remains unresolved or needs further investigation?*

- How can luck be operationalized and measured in performance management systems without abandoning analytical rigor?
- What specific mechanisms would make Mode 2 research effective in bridging different conceptualizations of causality between academics and practitioners?

## Summary
*2-3 sentence overview in your own words*

This paper argues that academics and business practitioners have fundamentally different views of luck's role in performance, with academics excluding it and practitioners invoking it to explain uncertain outcomes. The authors propose that Mode 2 research involving both groups could create more practically relevant knowledge for managing performance in volatile environments.
