## Research Question
*What problem or question does this paper address?*

[This paper examines whether locus-of-control orientation of high school and junior high school students could be modified through prescribed classroom activities. The study investigates if incorporating specific activities within regular classroom routines can shift students from external to internal locus-of-control orientation.]

## Methodology
*How did the researchers approach the problem?*

[The researchers used a pretest-posttest design with 245 students across 11 intact classrooms over a nine-week period. They administered the Nowicki-Strickland Locus of Control scale at the beginning and end of the study, comparing classes that incorporated prescribed activities versus those that did not.]

## Key Findings
*What are the main results or conclusions?*

[- Classes where teachers incorporated prescribed activities showed significantly greater internal locus-of-control orientation compared to classes without these activities
- The prescribed classroom activities successfully promoted awareness of contingencies between behaviors and outcomes
- Students who participated in activities that gave them more say in classroom decisions developed more internal control orientations]

## Core Argument
*What is the central thesis or contribution?*

[The central thesis is that locus-of-control orientation can be modified through structured classroom interventions that foster awareness of behavior-outcome contingencies and give students agency in classroom activities. This represents a practical approach to enhancing student motivation and academic outcomes by shifting external students toward internal control beliefs within regular classroom settings.]

## Evidence & Support
*What data or reasoning supports the claims?*

[The study used the validated Nowicki-Strickland Locus of Control scale with high test-retest reliability (correlations ranging from .60 to .90). The evidence comes from comparing pre- and post-treatment scores across 11 classes with varying implementation of prescribed activities.]

## Critical Notes

### Strengths

[- Conducted within regular classroom settings rather than special programs, making findings more practically applicable
- Used intact classrooms across multiple schools and grade levels, enhancing external validity]

### Limitations

[- The paper appears incomplete, cutting off during the methodology section, limiting full evaluation of the study design
- Lacks detailed description of control group procedures and specific prescribed activities implemented]

### Open Questions
*What remains unresolved or needs further investigation?*

[- Which specific classroom activities are most effective for promoting internal locus-of-control orientation
- How long-lasting are the observed changes in locus-of-control orientation beyond the nine-week intervention period]

## Summary
*2-3 sentence overview in your own words*

[This study investigated whether regular classroom activities could shift students from external to internal locus-of-control orientation, building on research showing internal control beliefs predict better academic outcomes. The researchers implemented prescribed activities designed to help students recognize behavior-outcome contingencies and gain agency in classroom decisions, finding that such interventions successfully promoted more internal control orientations.]
